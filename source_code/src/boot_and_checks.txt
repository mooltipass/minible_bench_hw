Mooltipass Standard:
- After production a custom test rig is used to program the Mooltipass firmware & fuses
- The test rig also pulls PB5 low, enabling electrical testing (see production\_programming_and_test\electrical_test.txt)
- During this test the IOs not used by the Mooltipass peripherals are tested, as well as the correct fuse settings
- Test result is shown on the test bed LEDs
- First boot is then detected by checking eeprom_read_word((uint16_t*)EEP_BOOTKEY_ADDR)
- This initializes default Mooltipass settings and formats the external Flash
- Functional test is then entered
- Mooltipass bundle needs to be sent, Mooltipass password set
- Flash & touch sensor presence are checked
- Tester is asked to approach hand, touch left/wheel/right
- Tester needs to insert card
- If functional test OK the Mooltipass logo will be displayed and correct value will be stored at EEP_BOOTKEY_ADDR
- All successive boots will check the fuse settings

Mooltipass Mini:
- The MCUs are programmed (flash & fuses) before assembly
- The fuses are set in such a way that the bootloader is started at device boot
- The bootloader checks if the security is set in place by checking the value of EEP_BOOT_PWD_SET in EEPROM
- If it isn't correctly set, it will start the firmware
- The firmware will check for first boot by checking the value of CORRECT_BOOTKEY in EEPROM
- This initializes default Mooltipass settings and formats the external Flash
- Functional testing is then entered
- Mooltipass bundle is set, AES keys are set
- Functional testing includes flash, accelerometer, wheel/click, smartcard slot and screen checks
- For further firmware upgrades, the main firmware sets EEP_BOOTKEY_ADDR to BOOTLOADER_BOOTKEY
- The device then reboots, the bootloader checks for this value and performs the upgrade
